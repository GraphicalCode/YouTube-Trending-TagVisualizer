The album unravels various aspects of the night, by realistically expressing emotions that many can relate to. Instead of portraying ‚Äúnocturne‚Äù through the usual sentimental and gloomy mood, NU‚ÄôEST uses various colors to express their emotions, illustrating ‚Äúnocturne‚Äù as a song of the night.The title track, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in Trouble,‚Äù depicts the moment one falls in love with another with an intense attraction. NU‚ÄôEST demonstrates a more upgraded transformation by adding bolder expressions to their sophisticated yet restrained performance style. The lyrics contain sentiments that grow deeper as the night falls, presenting a bolder thrill and fatal charm.  As the story of a deeper and vibrant night unfolds, listeners will be able to encounter captivating tones that awaken the senses, and also a more mature NU‚ÄôEST that hasn‚Äôt been revealed before.ÏßÄÎÇú 2019ÎÖÑ 10Ïõî, ÎØ∏Îãà 7Ïßë [The Table]ÏùÑ ÌÜµÌï¥ Îã¨ÏΩ§ÌïòÍ≤å ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùÑ ÏÜçÏÇ≠ÏòÄÎçò Ïù¥Îì§Ïù¥ ÏïΩ 7Í∞úÏõî ÎßåÏóê ÎØ∏Îãà 8Ïßë [The Nocturne]ÏúºÎ°ú ÎèåÏïÑÏôÄ Îòê Îã§Î•∏ ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùò ÏßôÏñ¥ÏßÑ Î¨¥ÎìúÎ•º ÏÑ†ÏÇ¨ÌïúÎã§.Ïó¨Îçü Î≤àÏß∏ ÎØ∏Îãà Ïï®Î≤î [The Nocturne]ÏùÄ Îß§ Ïï®Î≤îÎßàÎã§ ÌïúÍ≥Ñ ÏóÜÎäî Î≥ÄÌôîÎ•º Î≥¥Ïó¨Ï§Ä Îâ¥Ïù¥Ïä§Ìä∏Ïùò ÏÉâÎã§Î•∏ Î™®ÏäµÏùÑ Îã¥ÏïÑÎÇ¥Î©∞, Í∑∏Í∞Ñ Îâ¥Ïù¥Ïä§Ìä∏Í∞Ä Î≥¥Ïó¨Ï§Ä ÏÇ¨Îûë Ïù¥ÏïºÍ∏∞ÏóêÏÑú ÏÉàÎ°úÏö¥ ÏãúÏÑ†ÏùÑ Ï†úÏãúÌïúÎã§.

This video was inspired by one of my favorite shows growing up: Zoom! I learned so many fun recipes from it, some of which I still make today. So, I thought it'd be fun to try something similar with Toons. On the show they made chocolate bowls: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYI9DTznPlU, but we decided to make chocolate BALLOON bowls...and what a chocolate massacre it was. It wasn't perfect and it definitely was messy, but it turned out SO cute. Let me give you some tips so you're not dealing with the anxiety and stress of balloons popping and chocolate firing everywhere.-Use water balloons, because they're small and will be easier for you to create a bowl shape.-Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, which is basically a pot filled with boiling water with a glass bowl on top, so that your chocolate isn't on direct heat but gets super melty.-Spray the balloon LIGHTLY with cooking spray. It will help it from popping, but don't do too much or the chocolate won't stick.-Whatever you do, do NOT dip the balloons until the chocolate has cooled (as you can see, I learned the hard way).When you're all done, you'll end up with a cute little bowl that you can scoop ice cream or fruit in, and you get to eat the bowl! Just make sure to learn from my failures, before trying this activity with the kids (Luna absolutely loved it), and maybe make a few extra in case. Here is a link to the recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM_ZyL0FgQQ.

It has an open concept kitchen, living and dining space, a master bedroom and bathroom on the main floor, two bedrooms on the second floor, and the wraparound deck up top gives 360 degree views. Take a full tour of this sustainable tiny floating house!You can follow Jay Blackmore and see more photos from his DIY float home build here:https://www.instagram.com/floatinthekoots/Jay built it in his spare time (between working, spending time with his kids, and sailing) over the course of 4 years as an alternative housing option to the country home he had before, which he felt was too expensive, too far from town, and too much maintenance.  Now he doesn't have a lawn to mow or a driveway to shovel, and he is walking distance to all the amenities in town and just a few steps from his sailboat that is docked in the same marina.It's not an easy lifestyle though, everything that goes in and out of the float home has to be carried there, including propane tanks, pellets for the woodstove, groceries, garbage, etc. even in the middle of winter when docks are icy and the wind is blowing.  And it's quite public with boaters and paddlers going by all day.  But Jay says it's all about mindset and he's okay with these smaller challenges since it allows him a lifestyle that suits him perfectly.You can follow Jay Blackmore and see more photos from the float home build here:https://www.instagram.com/floatinthekoots/Thanks for watching!Mat & Danielle-------------------------------------------------------------STAY IN TOUCH!-------------------------------------------------------------Blog: www.exploringalternatives.caFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblogInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/-------------------------------------------------------------COMMENTS-------------------------------------------------------------We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.

Always talking about his fault.Yea I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up nigga. You don't wanna see me pissed off.Never tell a lie to a bitch dog. When it come to them ya gotta play it raw.And I never ever let the fuckery get to me. Niggas ain't worth my energy.Cut em off make em feel it. I aint dealing with nothing if it don't make sense to me.I never ever ever ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other sideI never ever ever ever put a bitch before the money. Gotta get it when it come to mine. VERSE 1:Lately I feel like its me vs me. Don't see competition why would you compete.Don't even gotta be woke, still gonna be up. I make a bag in my sleep.Cant get the hood outta me. You know where I be. Still posted up like I lease.Trust me those choppers gonna bang. Cavity teeth, you better not think this shit sweet.If the bitch bad put a stack in her rack. Im Dr Suess, Give me cat in the hat.Booty poke out and her stomach on snatch. Way to pretty to be fucked from the back.Count up some money then smoke me a plant. This shit got me higher than drama rent.Tash dat little bitch and she knowing she that. I said I was done, still doubled back.If you a side bitch you can not question me. You did some foul shit. You threw a tech at me.Cook it up right, they done gave me the recipe. Im in the Z06, police aint catching me.Im still ducking this bitch dats obsessed with me. Cause Im the dope like the coke in the 70's.Big Body double R truck I got Bo with me. Hog up the lane and they can't get close to me. HOOK:I aint ever ran from a nigga, If I did cut my legs off.I aint ever been with the hoe talk, snitch talk.

Gotta get it when it come to mine. VERSE 2:Check the thermostat, Ive been hot all summer. Try me you get whacked make it hard for ya mommaMoneybagg Runtz in the pack, get a bundle. Plaque and the sack, both of em doing numbers.I aint got a heart for a hoe. Thats a big no. No life worrying about the next hoe.Took back the keys to the Benzo. All in her feelings throwing clothes out the window.Lets take a AK cut in half and call it a drako. Im back one my old ways.Riding with that fire Call it that fuego.Life insurance on my chain. Reach for it, bust your brain. Loose noodle, no lo mein. Going out he way I came. HOOK:I aint ever ran from a nigga, If I did cut my legs off.I aint ever been with the hoe talk, snitch talk.

On Friday‚Äôs (May 8) episode of Young Money Radio, Tunechi and Eminem found out that they have a lot in common. The rap titans discussed everything from ESPN‚Äôs Michael Jordan documentary, The Last Dance, to working on new music during quarantine.Since launching the Beats 1 program two weeks ago, Lil Wayne has treated the audience to a wide range of guest interviews: hit-maker DJ Khaled, sports legend Deion Sanders, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith, and OVO boss Drake are just some of the notable figures who've appeared on the radio show. But it seems tonight's installment will be the hardest to top. There's no doubt the episode will be one for the books, as both rappers have established themselves as two of the biggest heavy-hitters in the game. Lil Wayne and Eminem have also collaborated throughout the years, joining forces on tracks like Second Chance, Drop the World, No Love, and Forever. Weezy spoke about working with Eminem during a February interview on Drink Champs, stating he always made sure to never get bodied on their joint tracks. #Eminem x #LilWayne laughed a lot during the interview: about track recording on self-isolation, working with Dr.Dre, #KidCudi recent tweet and much more"

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.

Available on demand June 12.--Facebook:  https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandFBTwitter:      https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandTWInstagram:  https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandIGSite: http://uni.pictures/StatenIsland--Over his storied career, Judd Apatow has elevated a series of promising young comedy talents to their first major big-screen performance, including Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Kristen Wiig, Amy Schumer and Kumail Nanjiani.¬†¬†This summer, Apatow directs Saturday Night Live breakout Pete Davidson in a bracing comedy about love, loss and laughter on Staten Island.¬†Scott (Davidson) has been a case of arrested development ever since his firefighter father died when he was seven. He‚Äôs now reached his mid-20s having achieved little, chasing a dream of becoming a tattoo artist that seems far out of reach. As his ambitious younger sister (Maude Apatow, HBO‚Äôs Euphoria) heads off to college, Scott is still living with his exhausted ER nurse mother (Oscar¬Æ winner Marisa Tomei) and spends his days smoking weed, hanging with the guys‚ÄîOscar (Ricky Velez, Master of None), Igor (Moises Arias, Five Feet Apart) and Richie (Lou Wilson, TV‚Äôs The Guest Book)‚Äîand secretly hooking up with his childhood friend Kelsey (Bel Powley, Apple TV+‚Äôs The Morning Show).¬†But when his mother starts dating a loudmouth firefighter named Ray (Bill Burr, Netflix‚Äôs F Is for Family), it sets off a chain of events that will force Scott to grapple with his grief and take his first tentative steps toward moving forward in life.¬†The film also stars Steve Buscemi as Papa, a veteran firefighter who takes Scott under his wing, and Pamela Adlon (FX‚Äôs Better Things) as Ray‚Äôs ex-wife, Gina. ¬†The King of Staten Island is directed by Apatow (Trainwreck, Knocked Up, The 40-Year-Old Virgin) from a script by Apatow, Davidson and former SNL writer Dave Sirus. It is produced by Apatow for his Apatow Productions alongside Barry Mendel. Together, the duo shared producing credits on the Academy Award¬Æ-nominated films The Big Sick and Bridesmaids, as well as This Is 40, Trainwreck and Funny People. The film‚Äôs executive producers are Pete Davidson, Michael Bederman and Judah Miller."

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY¬Æ Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani‚Äôs 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY¬Æ Award nod in the category of ‚ÄúBest Urban Contemporary Album.‚Äù On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe 50 Best Albums of 2017‚Äù and Rolling Stone‚Äôs ‚Äú20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.‚Äù Along the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B‚Äôs double-platinum ‚ÄúRing,‚Äù Kyle‚Äôs platinum ‚ÄúPLAYINWITME,‚Äù and Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Me,‚Äù to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles‚ÄîYou Should Be Here,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDistraction,‚Äù for which she received her second GRAMMY¬Æ nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles‚Äî‚ÄúGangsta,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Way‚Äù [feat. Chance the Rapper], ‚ÄúCRZY,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNights Like This‚Äù [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the ‚ÄúRule Breaker Award‚Äù as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019‚Äôs chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt. It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù and ‚ÄúEverybody Business.‚Äù In the end, you‚Äôll know exactly what‚Äôs on Kehlani‚Äôs mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt.Subscribe for the latest official music videos, official audio videos, performances, behind the scenes and more from Kehlani: https://Atlantic.lnk.to/KehlaniSubscribe#Kehlani #ItWasGoodUntilItWasnt #OpenPassionate"

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I‚Äôve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. A title may come close to suggesting that, but I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is also not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

We‚Äôve spoken with them. They simply appear to have been misguided by a few ‚Äúdiesel experts.‚Äù Hoonigan posted the latest episode of their Knuckle Busters Project Cars series in which they‚Äôre preparing a Gen V Camaro to run a standing mile at 200 MPH. The twist is that the car will be powered by a 1,000 horsepower fully-built Duramax LBZ fed by compound turbos. Hoonigan does nice work. Their series are informative and entertaining, and you can bet we‚Äôve been following the progress of this build and rooting for them. Going 200 in a diesel-powered Camaro is totally doable. After all, Banks went 222 MPH in a Cummins-powered Dodge Dakota in 2002. But when episode 10 of the series dropped this week, Banks fans were quick to light up our social feeds and Gale‚Äôs in particular. He was woken Monday to the sound of his phone vibrating off the nightstand. His Facebook Messenger was going nuts. ‚ÄúGale, have you seen the latest Hoonigan video? You‚Äôve gotta watch this!‚Äù Before the 78-year-old turbocharging guru had a chance to see the video, we convinced him to watch it on camera.

These unsavory creatures were first spotted in the United States in December 2019, and unfortunately, the nickname is not just a hyperbolic, wacky pro wrestler moniker. The hornet we're talking about is Vespa mandarinia. This monstrosity can grow up to two inches long, and bee breeder Susan Cobey of Washington State University's Department of Entomology describes them as, quote, like something out of a monster cartoon, with this huge yellow-orange face. There have been four verified sightings of the Asian giant hornet in Washington state, and a further two in Canada's British Columbia. Luckily, Rian Wojahn of Washington State's Department of Agriculture has told Time that officials are addressing the situation with an aggressive outreach and trapping campaign. So, hopefully, our near future doesn't include too many murder hornet swarms. Still, it's probably a good idea to bone up on these things, just in case. Here's everything you need to know about the frighteningly-named murder hornets.If you see an Asian giant hornet, we have good news and bad news. The good news is that they don't seem to actively target humans. However, the bad news is that if they do decide to sting you, you're in for a world of pain. Even beekeeper suits can't stop their stings, which are Bad with a capital B. Conrad B√©rub√©, a beekeeper who was stung around seven times while getting rid of a nest, described the sensation to The New York Times as the most painful sting he's ever experienced, and he's been stung a lot. The sting is said to feel a bit like hot metal being injected into your body. Oh, and of course the murder hornet's sting is potentially lethal, though that can be said of any sort of hornet venom in sufficient volume. This particular venom includes a heaping helping of neurotoxins, and while one sting won't end your life, enough of them might. Furthermore, these being hornets, they're able to sting multiple times without dying. This is not a theoretical scenario, either. Reportedly, murder hornets kill as many as 50 people in Japan every year.

CEO Craig Jelinek is clear about who the store was protecting when he announced the new rule at the end of April. Jelinek wrote in a statement,We know some members may find this inconvenient or objectionable, but under the circumstances we believe the added safety is worth any inconvenience. This is not simply a matter of personal choice; a face covering protects not just the wearer, but others too.The new rule is the latest in a series of measures Costco has taken to contain the spread of COVID-19. Other steps include limiting the number of members per card to two, as well as setting aside new shopping times for senior citizens and people with disabilities. The only exceptions Costco will make for the mask rule include children under 2 years old and those who have respiratory problems. The face mask rule covers all of Costco's stores in the United States, and along with the new face mask rule, Costco announced it would resume regular operating hours.The new policy has triggered some Costco members who consider the face mask rule to be unjustified and unfair. Some say they will refuse to comply, while others say they will terminate their memberships, and their complaints are trending under the hashtag Boycott Costco.Twitter user Talia wrote, in part,Adios #Costco! Won't be renewing my membership! I REFUSE to mask up for the low IQ mob that's falling for the propaganda‚Ä¶Other members, like Twitter user R Hunter, claimed the masks were useless against COVID-19, despite recommendations from the CDC that Americans should wear them in grocery stores, writing,Simply ridiculous! Not based on science but fear. Learn the fact of the virus Costco. Until you lift your requirement I will not shop there. Sam's [Club] is just across the street!Some also said they would show their displeasure with Costco's new policy by using their membership, like Twitter user chuck lorre fan, who wrote,I Will be getting a refund for the remainder of my Costco membership. I suggest everyone do the same. Know your constitutional rights!Some shoppers may be unhappy with Costco over the new face mask rule, but it shouldn't expect any love from some of its employees, who aren't happy with the company either. BuzzFeed News reports that dozens of employees across the country say Costco has all but abandoned social distancing protocols in many of their stores.Store managers stand accused of increasing the number of people allowed in the store at any time, making it a challenge to maintain social distancing protocols. Some employees say they have also seen members of Costco's corporate leadership visit the stores and ask for cones and tape which mark social distancing queues to be removed. One Texas-based Costco employee told BuzzFeed News,[Management] is in fear of turning people away. They still do not care that we are in the middle of a pandemic. They just want sales. They are allowing up to 600 people in the store at a time. Employees have to dodge people like it's a minefield. It's just a complete breakdown at every level.BuzzFeed News also reports that Costco has refused to address these media enquiries, but in a past internal email, Craig Jelinek told restless employees that as a company, quote, We've undertaken countless and extraordinary changes in our warehouses...for the health, safety, and well being of our employees and members.No matter what its disgruntled members or employees say, Costco appears to be sticking to its guns over the face mask policy for now. According to Jelinek,We're choosing to err on the side of safety in our shopping environments. Costco has continued to operate during this crisis as an essential business in all of our communities, and our employees are on the front lines. As part of a community, we believe this simple act of safety and courtesy is one that Costco members and employees can undertake together.The company also reminded its members that the CDC recommendation on the use of face masks is clear: People should use cloth face coverings, quote, in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain ([for example] grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.Costco also continues to emphasize the importance of social distancing along with the use of face masks, to prevent people who might be asymptomatic from spreading the virus to people who are well.#Costco #BoycottCostco #SupermarketsRead the full article here: https://www.mashed.com/206563/the-real-reason-shoppers-are-boycotting-costco-right-now/"

Ross Lord has more on the lessons other provinces can take from New Brunswick's success.And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced a $252 million aid package for Canadian farmers and food processors struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. As Abigail Bimman explains, the industry says it needs more help now, or else food prices will soar.Turning away from COVID-19, about 6,000 fires burn across Canada every year, But Natural Resources Canada expects that number will soar this year.

The album unravels various aspects of the night, by realistically expressing emotions that many can relate to. Instead of portraying ‚Äúnocturne‚Äù through the usual sentimental and gloomy mood, NU‚ÄôEST uses various colors to express their emotions, illustrating ‚Äúnocturne‚Äù as a song of the night.The title track, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in Trouble,‚Äù depicts the moment one falls in love with another with an intense attraction. NU‚ÄôEST demonstrates a more upgraded transformation by adding bolder expressions to their sophisticated yet restrained performance style. The lyrics contain sentiments that grow deeper as the night falls, presenting a bolder thrill and fatal charm.  As the story of a deeper and vibrant night unfolds, listeners will be able to encounter captivating tones that awaken the senses, and also a more mature NU‚ÄôEST that hasn‚Äôt been revealed before.ÏßÄÎÇú 2019ÎÖÑ 10Ïõî, ÎØ∏Îãà 7Ïßë [The Table]ÏùÑ ÌÜµÌï¥ Îã¨ÏΩ§ÌïòÍ≤å ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùÑ ÏÜçÏÇ≠ÏòÄÎçò Ïù¥Îì§Ïù¥ ÏïΩ 7Í∞úÏõî ÎßåÏóê ÎØ∏Îãà 8Ïßë [The Nocturne]ÏúºÎ°ú ÎèåÏïÑÏôÄ Îòê Îã§Î•∏ ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùò ÏßôÏñ¥ÏßÑ Î¨¥ÎìúÎ•º ÏÑ†ÏÇ¨ÌïúÎã§.Ïó¨Îçü Î≤àÏß∏ ÎØ∏Îãà Ïï®Î≤î [The Nocturne]ÏùÄ Îß§ Ïï®Î≤îÎßàÎã§ ÌïúÍ≥Ñ ÏóÜÎäî Î≥ÄÌôîÎ•º Î≥¥Ïó¨Ï§Ä Îâ¥Ïù¥Ïä§Ìä∏Ïùò ÏÉâÎã§Î•∏ Î™®ÏäµÏùÑ Îã¥ÏïÑÎÇ¥Î©∞, Í∑∏Í∞Ñ Îâ¥Ïù¥Ïä§Ìä∏Í∞Ä Î≥¥Ïó¨Ï§Ä ÏÇ¨Îûë Ïù¥ÏïºÍ∏∞ÏóêÏÑú ÏÉàÎ°úÏö¥ ÏãúÏÑ†ÏùÑ Ï†úÏãúÌïúÎã§.

Get the latest news, sport, business and weather from the BBC's Breakfast team live on iPlayer daily from 6am.Boris Johnson will reveal more detail on his plans to reopen society in England, after unveiling the first sketch of his road map out of the coronavirus lockdown.The prime minister will answer questions from MPs and the public on Monday while No 10 will publish its 50-page official guidance in Parliament.Labour's Sir Keir Starmer criticised the PM's plan for lacking clarity.It comes as Scotland and Wales rejected No 10's new stay alert slogan.In Sunday's televised address to the nation, Mr Johnson announced a conditional plan to reopen society, allowing people in England to spend more time outdoors from Wednesday.The PM also said people who could not work from home - including those in the manufacturing and construction industries - should return to the workplace from Monday but avoid public transport.Mr Johnson said the government would modify lockdown measures over three careful steps through to July.A new Covid Alert System with five levels would influence how quickly the lockdown - which was first announced on 23 March - could be changed.The first step will allow people to take unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise, sit or sunbathe in parks and play sports with household members from Wednesday.The changes in guidelines will also allow two people from different households to meet in a park if they stay two metres apart.He hoped by the second step - at the earliest by 1 June - there could be a phased reopening of shops and some primary aged pupils could return to school.The third step could see some hospitality businesses and other public places reopen - if the numbers support it - but not earlier than 1 July.The prime minister stressed this was all conditional on a series of big ifs and he would not hesitate to put on the brakes if there are further outbreaks of the virus.Mr Johnson is set to give a statement to Parliament on Monday, with more information expected on a Covid-19 alert system, use of face masks, and the return of professional football.But Sir Keir said Mr Johnson's speech raised as many questions as it answers.BBC Breakfast | BBC News | BBC#BBC #BBCiPlayer #BBCNews #BBCNewsLive #BBCCoronavirus #Coronavirus #Covid19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #Corona #CoronavirusUKAll our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights.

We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries before 2020 and all 7 continents, we have no plans to slow down anytime soon, and we are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)"

Always talking about his fault.Yea I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up nigga. You don't wanna see me pissed off.Never tell a lie to a bitch dog. When it come to them ya gotta play it raw.And I never ever let the fuckery get to me. Niggas ain't worth my energy.Cut em off make em feel it. I aint dealing with nothing if it don't make sense to me.I never ever ever ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other sideI never ever ever ever put a bitch before the money. Gotta get it when it come to mine. VERSE 1:Lately I feel like its me vs me. Don't see competition why would you compete.Don't even gotta be woke, still gonna be up. I make a bag in my sleep.Cant get the hood outta me. You know where I be. Still posted up like I lease.Trust me those choppers gonna bang. Cavity teeth, you better not think this shit sweet.If the bitch bad put a stack in her rack. Im Dr Suess, Give me cat in the hat.Booty poke out and her stomach on snatch. Way to pretty to be fucked from the back.Count up some money then smoke me a plant. This shit got me higher than drama rent.Tash dat little bitch and she knowing she that. I said I was done, still doubled back.If you a side bitch you can not question me. You did some foul shit. You threw a tech at me.Cook it up right, they done gave me the recipe. Im in the Z06, police aint catching me.Im still ducking this bitch dats obsessed with me. Cause Im the dope like the coke in the 70's.Big Body double R truck I got Bo with me. Hog up the lane and they can't get close to me. HOOK:I aint ever ran from a nigga, If I did cut my legs off.I aint ever been with the hoe talk, snitch talk. Always talking about his fault.Yea I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up nigga. You don't wanna see me pissed off.Never tell a lie to a bitch dog. When it come to them ya gotta play it raw.And I never ever let the fuckery get to me. Niggas ain't worth my energy.Cut em off make em feel it. I aint dealing with nothing if it don't make sense to me.I never ever ever ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other sideI never ever ever ever put a bitch before the money. Gotta get it when it come to mine. VERSE 2:Check the thermostat, Ive been hot all summer. Try me you get whacked make it hard for ya mommaMoneybagg Runtz in the pack, get a bundle. Plaque and the sack, both of em doing numbers.I aint got a heart for a hoe. Thats a big no. No life worrying about the next hoe.Took back the keys to the Benzo. All in her feelings throwing clothes out the window.Lets take a AK cut in half and call it a drako. Im back one my old ways.Riding with that fire Call it that fuego.Life insurance on my chain. Reach for it, bust your brain. Loose noodle, no lo mein. Going out he way I came. HOOK:I aint ever ran from a nigga, If I did cut my legs off.I aint ever been with the hoe talk, snitch talk.

Alfredo is determined to cure Violetta of her tuberculosis, and the couple leave Paris and begin a contented life in the country. But Violetta's happiness is destroyed when Alfredo's father Giorgio Germont pays her a visit.Violetta‚Äôs scandalous relationship with Alfredo is jeopardizing Giorgio Germont‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs engagement, and Germont persuades Violetta to leave his son. Heartbroken, Violetta promises not to tell Alfredo why. Alfredo is stunned when Violetta disappears, and decides she must have left him from self-interest. He confronts her at a Paris party and leaves her. Only when Violetta is dying does he learn the truth.üí°  Background to the production:Verdi based La traviata on Alexandre Dumas fils's novel and play La Dame aux cam√©lias, inspired by the life and death of the real Parisian courtesan Marie Duplessis. Verdi offered a more complex and sympathetic portrayal of his heroine than Dumas, highlighting Violetta's noble nature and her devotion to Alfredo. La traviata had an initially lukewarm reception, but after Verdi revised the work in 1854 it became enormously successful. It is currently the most performed opera in the world, and the role of Violetta a favourite for many star sopranos.Richard Eyre's stunning naturalistic production contrasts the superficial glamour of 19th-century Parisian high life with intimate scenes for Violetta with Alfredo and Giorgio Germont, culminating in the heart-breaking final act. Verdi's sublime score contains some of his most inspired arias and duets, including Violetta's introspective 'Ah fors'√® lui' and hedonistic 'Sempre libera', Violetta and Germont's poignant Act II encounter and Alfredo and Violetta's 'Parigi, o cara', in which they dream of a happy future.--With warm thanks to Ruinart and all the supporters of The Royal Opera.--üìÄ This recording is also available on Opus Arte DVD and Blu-Ray:https://Naxos.lnk.to/OA1040DUK!ROHstreamIDAlso available from Opus Arte:üìÄ Verdi: Il TrovatoreVerdi‚Äôs opera of passion, blood, fire and vengeance comes to the stage in an atmospheric production by David B√∂sch.

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.

Pete Davidson is #TheKingOfStatenIsland. Available on demand June 12.--Facebook:  https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandFBTwitter:      https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandTWInstagram:  https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandIGSite: http://uni.pictures/StatenIsland--Over his storied career, Judd Apatow has elevated a series of promising young comedy talents to their first major big-screen performance, including Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Kristen Wiig, Amy Schumer and Kumail Nanjiani.¬†¬†This summer, Apatow directs Saturday Night Live breakout Pete Davidson in a bracing comedy about love, loss and laughter on Staten Island.¬†Scott (Davidson) has been a case of arrested development ever since his firefighter father died when he was seven. He‚Äôs now reached his mid-20s having achieved little, chasing a dream of becoming a tattoo artist that seems far out of reach. As his ambitious younger sister (Maude Apatow, HBO‚Äôs Euphoria) heads off to college, Scott is still living with his exhausted ER nurse mother (Oscar¬Æ winner Marisa Tomei) and spends his days smoking weed, hanging with the guys‚ÄîOscar (Ricky Velez, Master of None), Igor (Moises Arias, Five Feet Apart) and Richie (Lou Wilson, TV‚Äôs The Guest Book)‚Äîand secretly hooking up with his childhood friend Kelsey (Bel Powley, Apple TV+‚Äôs The Morning Show).¬†But when his mother starts dating a loudmouth firefighter named Ray (Bill Burr, Netflix‚Äôs F Is for Family), it sets off a chain of events that will force Scott to grapple with his grief and take his first tentative steps toward moving forward in life.¬†The film also stars Steve Buscemi as Papa, a veteran firefighter who takes Scott under his wing, and Pamela Adlon (FX‚Äôs Better Things) as Ray‚Äôs ex-wife, Gina. ¬†The King of Staten Island is directed by Apatow (Trainwreck, Knocked Up, The 40-Year-Old Virgin) from a script by Apatow, Davidson and former SNL writer Dave Sirus. It is produced by Apatow for his Apatow Productions alongside Barry Mendel.

It says the economy is on course for the sharpest annual contraction for 300 years, with the coronavirus pandemic dramatically reducing jobs and incomes. The Governor of the Bank of England said the economy is expected to contract by 14%, twice as big a downturn as the great crash of 2008.  Unemployment could double to 9% although the Bank of England is forecasting that  the economy will bounce back next year.The Prime Minister will make a public statement on Sunday setting out the next stages of lockdown and any plans to ease it. But Boris Johnson has said his government will advance with maximum caution. In Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that she will not be pressured into acting too early to ease the lockdown, saying getting it right is ‚Äúa matter of life and death‚Äù.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I‚Äôve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. A title may come close to suggesting that, but I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is also not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

But it didn't have to be that way -- and it's not too late for the US to change course.Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOFew Americans alive today have ever seen unemployment numbers as bad as they are right now. At the end of April 2020, economists estimated that between 13 and 18 percent of US workers were unemployed. It's the highest rate since the Great Depression. That figure can seem somewhat inevitable; the unfortunate but unavoidable cost of economic lockdown. It‚Äôs why, in response, Congress has prioritized shoring up unemployment insurance benefits.But a handful of European countries have shown that mass unemployment isn‚Äôt a given in a situation like this.

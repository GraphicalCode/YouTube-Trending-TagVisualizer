Always talking about his fault.Yea I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up nigga. You don't wanna see me pissed off.Never tell a lie to a bitch dog. When it come to them ya gotta play it raw.And I never ever let the fuckery get to me. Niggas ain't worth my energy.Cut em off make em feel it. I aint dealing with nothing if it don't make sense to me.I never ever ever ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other sideI never ever ever ever put a bitch before the money. Gotta get it when it come to mine. VERSE 1:Lately I feel like its me vs me. Don't see competition why would you compete.Don't even gotta be woke, still gonna be up. I make a bag in my sleep.Cant get the hood outta me. You know where I be. Still posted up like I lease.Trust me those choppers gonna bang. Cavity teeth, you better not think this shit sweet.If the bitch bad put a stack in her rack. Im Dr Suess, Give me cat in the hat.Booty poke out and her stomach on snatch. Way to pretty to be fucked from the back.Count up some money then smoke me a plant. This shit got me higher than drama rent.Tash dat little bitch and she knowing she that. I said I was done, still doubled back.If you a side bitch you can not question me. You did some foul shit. You threw a tech at me.Cook it up right, they done gave me the recipe. Im in the Z06, police aint catching me.Im still ducking this bitch dats obsessed with me. Cause Im the dope like the coke in the 70's.Big Body double R truck I got Bo with me. Hog up the lane and they can't get close to me. HOOK:I aint ever ran from a nigga, If I did cut my legs off.I aint ever been with the hoe talk, snitch talk. Always talking about his fault.Yea I'm a stand up nigga, got my bands up nigga. You don't wanna see me pissed off.Never tell a lie to a bitch dog. When it come to them ya gotta play it raw.And I never ever let the fuckery get to me. Niggas ain't worth my energy.Cut em off make em feel it. I aint dealing with nothing if it don't make sense to me.I never ever ever ever go against my kind for some niggas on the other sideI never ever ever ever put a bitch before the money. Gotta get it when it come to mine. VERSE 2:Check the thermostat, Ive been hot all summer. Try me you get whacked make it hard for ya mommaMoneybagg Runtz in the pack, get a bundle. Plaque and the sack, both of em doing numbers.I aint got a heart for a hoe. Thats a big no. No life worrying about the next hoe.Took back the keys to the Benzo. All in her feelings throwing clothes out the window.Lets take a AK cut in half and call it a drako. Im back one my old ways.Riding with that fire Call it that fuego.Life insurance on my chain. Reach for it, bust your brain. Loose noodle, no lo mein. Going out he way I came. HOOK:I aint ever ran from a nigga, If I did cut my legs off.I aint ever been with the hoe talk, snitch talk.

The album unravels various aspects of the night, by realistically expressing emotions that many can relate to. Instead of portraying “nocturne” through the usual sentimental and gloomy mood, NU’EST uses various colors to express their emotions, illustrating “nocturne” as a song of the night.The title track, “I’m in Trouble,” depicts the moment one falls in love with another with an intense attraction. NU’EST demonstrates a more upgraded transformation by adding bolder expressions to their sophisticated yet restrained performance style. The lyrics contain sentiments that grow deeper as the night falls, presenting a bolder thrill and fatal charm.  As the story of a deeper and vibrant night unfolds, listeners will be able to encounter captivating tones that awaken the senses, and also a more mature NU’EST that hasn’t been revealed before.지난 2019년 10월, 미니 7집 [The Table]을 통해 달콤하게 사랑을 속삭였던 이들이 약 7개월 만에 미니 8집 [The Nocturne]으로 돌아와 또 다른 사랑의 짙어진 무드를 선사한다.여덟 번째 미니 앨범 [The Nocturne]은 매 앨범마다 한계 없는 변화를 보여준 뉴이스트의 색다른 모습을 담아내며, 그간 뉴이스트가 보여준 사랑 이야기에서 새로운 시선을 제시한다. 이번 앨범은 모든 사람들이 매일 마주치게 되는, 감정이 조금 더 솔직해지는 순간인 ‘밤’이라는 시간에 집중하여 밤의 여러 가지 모습을 누구나 공감할 수 있는 현실적인 표현과 이야기로 풀어냈다. 일반적인 ‘녹턴’이 가진 서정적이고 슬픈 야상곡이 아닌 다양한 색채로 표현하는 밤의 노래라는 의미를 더해 뉴이스트만의 감성과 언어로 야상곡을 완성시켰다. 타이틀곡 ‘I’m in Trouble’은 강렬한 이끌림으로 서로에게 빠지는 순간을 표현한 곡으로, 뉴이스트만의 세련되면서도 절제된 퍼포먼스에 과감해진 표현력을 더해 한층 더 업그레이드된 모습으로 변화를 시도하였다. 깊어질 밤 속에 더욱 깊어질 감성을 직설적인 가사로 담아냈으며 기존에 뉴이스트가 선보인 모습과는 또 다른 과감함과 짜릿한 전율을 선사, 치명적인 매력을 느낄 수 있다.이번 앨범을 통해 ‘밤’이라는 시간 속 더욱 짙고 선명해진 표현력만큼 감각을 일깨우는 매혹적인 음색과 함께 훨씬 더 성숙해진 뉴이스트를 만날 수 있을 것이다.NU'EST 'The Nocturne' oniTunes : https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-nocturne-ep/1512114865?l=ko&ls=1Spotify : https://open.spotify.com/album/5j8qRyyqFwXkIH7boJ6m9N?si=N5h3Fo_tQ9W6Z5Gv6m_9EwDeezer : https://www.deezer.com/us/album/146833622Tidal : https://listen.tidal.com/album/140516191QQ : https://y.qq.com/n/yqq/album/003zwYiQ1FnUYq.html#stat=y_new.singer.index.album_pic#뉴이스트 #NUEST #The_Nocturne #Im_in_TroublePledis Official Homepage: http://www.pledis.co.kr/NU'EST Official Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pledisnuestNU'EST Official Twitter: https://twitter.com/nuestnewsNU'EST Official Fancafe: http://cafe.daum.net/nuestNU'EST Official Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/nuest_official/NU'EST Official Weibo: https://www.weibo.com/pledisnuestⓒ Pledis Entertainment.

This video was inspired by one of my favorite shows growing up: Zoom! I learned so many fun recipes from it, some of which I still make today. So, I thought it'd be fun to try something similar with Toons. On the show they made chocolate bowls: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYI9DTznPlU, but we decided to make chocolate BALLOON bowls...and what a chocolate massacre it was. It wasn't perfect and it definitely was messy, but it turned out SO cute. Let me give you some tips so you're not dealing with the anxiety and stress of balloons popping and chocolate firing everywhere.-Use water balloons, because they're small and will be easier for you to create a bowl shape.-Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, which is basically a pot filled with boiling water with a glass bowl on top, so that your chocolate isn't on direct heat but gets super melty.-Spray the balloon LIGHTLY with cooking spray. It will help it from popping, but don't do too much or the chocolate won't stick.-Whatever you do, do NOT dip the balloons until the chocolate has cooled (as you can see, I learned the hard way).When you're all done, you'll end up with a cute little bowl that you can scoop ice cream or fruit in, and you get to eat the bowl! Just make sure to learn from my failures, before trying this activity with the kids (Luna absolutely loved it), and maybe make a few extra in case. Here is a link to the recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM_ZyL0FgQQ. She suggests dark chocolate holds the best...good luck!Visit:https://cravingsbychrissyteigen.com/Follow Cravings by Chrissy Teigen on social here: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CravingsbyChrissyTeigenInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/CravingsbyChrissyTeigenTwitter: https://twitter.com/cravings"

Plus never before seen footage of the birth of this tornado, mesocyclone time lapse, well defined clear slot, entire wide angle view of the storm and tornado in blue skies, eventually wrapped up with a tornado and rainbow. COPYRIGHT PECOS HANK LLC 2020To license tornado footage contact hankschyma@gmail.comSUPPORT THIS CHANNELhttps://www.patreon.com/pecoshankCHASE ACCOUNT April 22, 2020 Madill Oklahoma:Three days prior to this tornado event,  the Storm Predication Center issued a risk of severe storms in Oklahoma, Texas and vicinity for April 22nd… initiating near a dryline.  The next day, The risk was upgraded with a 10% chance of significant tornadoes EF2 and above. On the morning of April 22nd, the day of the event, the outlined risk of tornadoes was expanded. At 1:09 PM on April 22, cumulus clouds were developing along the dryline and by 1:12 PM a Mesoscale discussion was issued… anticipating a few tornadoes.At 3:20, a squadron of storms was developing along the dryline and by 4:01pm they were maturing into small supercells, marching eastward.  Several of the storms produced tornadoes, but I chased the storm that impacted the town of Madill and by 4:50 PM I was observing a tight rotating updraft approach the town.  The tornado touched down on the south side of Madill and earned EF2 status right out the gate as it snapped power poles and flung trees and large branches high into the air.  THIS WAS AN UNUSUAL TORNADO to observe as a swirl of dryer air was being ingested into the storm slicing an impressive clear slot around the tornado and providing a rare view up into the engine of the supercell. This swirl of air is the Rear Flank Downdraft (RFD) and in most cases has visible precipitation accompanying it that often is wrapped around the tornado like curtains, obscuring it in some manner.  The small mesocyclone and low precipitation storm mode tracking near paved routes I’d previously traveled gave me a confidence to dare extremely close videography while keeping a close eye on the large debris perimeter as well as the power lines above me.IN THIS HIGH RESOLUTION VIDEO you can observe strong upward motion shredding trees of leaves giving the tornado a slight green color near the ground.  Large sections of trees or medium sized entire trees are clearly visible flying through the air and being slammed back to the ground with missile force. A satellite dish is ripped from the tower and falls at a 45 degree angle or so before being launched horizontal some distance off frame and high detail of power flashes arc into the air as the tornado crosses the intersection.  Scientifically, the most valuable shot is probably the wide angle slow motion of the debris once the tornado impacts the warehouses.  Unfortunately, this is the only stable video of this event, so triangulating particle motions is not possible.  If we were to have another stable perspective, Dr Anton Seimon and his team could have used the data set to study tornadoes. WHY SO CLOSE???As stated in the video, the rain free highly visible nature of this storm, small compact size and reasonable motion made this an ideal storm to attempt up close video.  The paved roads I had previously traveled greatly reduced risk of unknowns such as road construction and poor road conditions, etc.  The greatest concern of mine was the power lines near me and throughout the event I was positioning myself upwind of them.  This was extremely risky even for the most seasoned and experienced storm chaser and in hindsight I could have gotten just as dramatic video another 50-100 meters back.  I was anticipating the tornado to continue to track east northeast but after staking my ground, the tornado took a slight arc east southeast tracking extremely close to me. Though closer than I anticipated, I still felt confident I didn't have to abandon my post. My chase vehicle has one small dent in the side from a missile."

Pete Davidson is #TheKingOfStatenIsland. Available on demand June 12.--Facebook:  https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandFBTwitter:      https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandTWInstagram:  https://uni.pictures/StatenIslandIGSite: http://uni.pictures/StatenIsland--Over his storied career, Judd Apatow has elevated a series of promising young comedy talents to their first major big-screen performance, including Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, Kristen Wiig, Amy Schumer and Kumail Nanjiani.  This summer, Apatow directs Saturday Night Live breakout Pete Davidson in a bracing comedy about love, loss and laughter on Staten Island. Scott (Davidson) has been a case of arrested development ever since his firefighter father died when he was seven. He’s now reached his mid-20s having achieved little, chasing a dream of becoming a tattoo artist that seems far out of reach. As his ambitious younger sister (Maude Apatow, HBO’s Euphoria) heads off to college, Scott is still living with his exhausted ER nurse mother (Oscar® winner Marisa Tomei) and spends his days smoking weed, hanging with the guys—Oscar (Ricky Velez, Master of None), Igor (Moises Arias, Five Feet Apart) and Richie (Lou Wilson, TV’s The Guest Book)—and secretly hooking up with his childhood friend Kelsey (Bel Powley, Apple TV+’s The Morning Show). But when his mother starts dating a loudmouth firefighter named Ray (Bill Burr, Netflix’s F Is for Family), it sets off a chain of events that will force Scott to grapple with his grief and take his first tentative steps toward moving forward in life. The film also stars Steve Buscemi as Papa, a veteran firefighter who takes Scott under his wing, and Pamela Adlon (FX’s Better Things) as Ray’s ex-wife, Gina.  The King of Staten Island is directed by Apatow (Trainwreck, Knocked Up, The 40-Year-Old Virgin) from a script by Apatow, Davidson and former SNL writer Dave Sirus. It is produced by Apatow for his Apatow Productions alongside Barry Mendel. Together, the duo shared producing credits on the Academy Award®-nominated films The Big Sick and Bridesmaids, as well as This Is 40, Trainwreck and Funny People. The film’s executive producers are Pete Davidson, Michael Bederman and Judah Miller."

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” Along the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.Subscribe for the latest official music videos, official audio videos, performances, behind the scenes and more from Kehlani: https://Atlantic.lnk.to/KehlaniSubscribe#Kehlani #ItWasGoodUntilItWasnt #OpenPassionate"

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right—within two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez.

It is unclear at this point if this is the actual name of the baby, and how the parents will want it to be pronounced if it turns out to be. Congrats to Grimes & Elon in any case. Some have speculated that it might be a code tweeted by Elon to say the name is Xavier, others wonder if it might be a joke. For what we know or can speculate upon, this name could be pronounced as X, pretty straightforward: X. Then the lettersÆ together is a latin symbol known as an ash, whose sound is somewhere in between A and E, like an A in ‘cat’ or ‘bad’, so Æ, and finally A-12, which in English would be said A12. So overall: X Æ A-12. X Æ A-12 is as good a speculation on how to pronounce this name as we can make at this point.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I’ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. A title may come close to suggesting that, but I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is also not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

These unsavory creatures were first spotted in the United States in December 2019, and unfortunately, the nickname is not just a hyperbolic, wacky pro wrestler moniker. The hornet we're talking about is Vespa mandarinia. This monstrosity can grow up to two inches long, and bee breeder Susan Cobey of Washington State University's Department of Entomology describes them as, quote, like something out of a monster cartoon, with this huge yellow-orange face. There have been four verified sightings of the Asian giant hornet in Washington state, and a further two in Canada's British Columbia. Luckily, Rian Wojahn of Washington State's Department of Agriculture has told Time that officials are addressing the situation with an aggressive outreach and trapping campaign. So, hopefully, our near future doesn't include too many murder hornet swarms. Still, it's probably a good idea to bone up on these things, just in case. Here's everything you need to know about the frighteningly-named murder hornets.If you see an Asian giant hornet, we have good news and bad news. The good news is that they don't seem to actively target humans. However, the bad news is that if they do decide to sting you, you're in for a world of pain. Even beekeeper suits can't stop their stings, which are Bad with a capital B. Conrad Bérubé, a beekeeper who was stung around seven times while getting rid of a nest, described the sensation to The New York Times as the most painful sting he's ever experienced, and he's been stung a lot. The sting is said to feel a bit like hot metal being injected into your body. Oh, and of course the murder hornet's sting is potentially lethal, though that can be said of any sort of hornet venom in sufficient volume. This particular venom includes a heaping helping of neurotoxins, and while one sting won't end your life, enough of them might. Furthermore, these being hornets, they're able to sting multiple times without dying. This is not a theoretical scenario, either. Reportedly, murder hornets kill as many as 50 people in Japan every year.

Born and raised in L.A., the 24-year-old self-taught singer-rapper is a vet of sorts. The arts were central to her upbringing, and she started sharing her music on Soundcloud back in 2013. A year later she dropped her much-buzzed-about ‘Purrr!’ EP. Ever since, she’s nurtured an ever-growing array of feverish fans who revere her for combining a radiant charisma with unique flow and tongue-in-cheek lyrics (see: the irresistible“MOOO!”). Seems like Doja has designed her version of alt-R&B to take off in any direction she chooses. Tours with Lizzo and Theophilius London led right into 2018’s impressive ‘Amala,’ her debut proper, followed by last year’s ‘Hot Pink.’ That album’s “Say So” is currently clocking big numbers. Arresting visuals help. Her videos for both her radio juggernaut and Rules are wildly fun. When the Vevo production team united with the feline phenom to figure out performance ideas, the creative juices were flowing. The goal? Put the “cat” in Doja Cat - a decision that resulted in what’s probably our most ambitious studio build to date for a LIFT performance. For her “Streets” performance, we built Doja a massive bowl of 2%, where she was clearly in her element. And if that isn’t peak, then the human-sized scratching house of her Say So performance is. Dressed in full cat-ear regalia, she pawed her way through the two-story structure, purring the lyrics to her R&B throwback jam, which currently sits nicely in the Top 10 pop charts and is a smash hit for the spring of 2020.

CEO Craig Jelinek is clear about who the store was protecting when he announced the new rule at the end of April. Jelinek wrote in a statement,We know some members may find this inconvenient or objectionable, but under the circumstances we believe the added safety is worth any inconvenience. This is not simply a matter of personal choice; a face covering protects not just the wearer, but others too.The new rule is the latest in a series of measures Costco has taken to contain the spread of COVID-19. Other steps include limiting the number of members per card to two, as well as setting aside new shopping times for senior citizens and people with disabilities. The only exceptions Costco will make for the mask rule include children under 2 years old and those who have respiratory problems. The face mask rule covers all of Costco's stores in the United States, and along with the new face mask rule, Costco announced it would resume regular operating hours.The new policy has triggered some Costco members who consider the face mask rule to be unjustified and unfair. Some say they will refuse to comply, while others say they will terminate their memberships, and their complaints are trending under the hashtag Boycott Costco.Twitter user Talia wrote, in part,Adios #Costco! Won't be renewing my membership! I REFUSE to mask up for the low IQ mob that's falling for the propaganda…Other members, like Twitter user R Hunter, claimed the masks were useless against COVID-19, despite recommendations from the CDC that Americans should wear them in grocery stores, writing,Simply ridiculous! Not based on science but fear. Learn the fact of the virus Costco. Until you lift your requirement I will not shop there. Sam's [Club] is just across the street!Some also said they would show their displeasure with Costco's new policy by using their membership, like Twitter user chuck lorre fan, who wrote,I Will be getting a refund for the remainder of my Costco membership. I suggest everyone do the same. Know your constitutional rights!Some shoppers may be unhappy with Costco over the new face mask rule, but it shouldn't expect any love from some of its employees, who aren't happy with the company either. BuzzFeed News reports that dozens of employees across the country say Costco has all but abandoned social distancing protocols in many of their stores.Store managers stand accused of increasing the number of people allowed in the store at any time, making it a challenge to maintain social distancing protocols. Some employees say they have also seen members of Costco's corporate leadership visit the stores and ask for cones and tape which mark social distancing queues to be removed. One Texas-based Costco employee told BuzzFeed News,[Management] is in fear of turning people away. They still do not care that we are in the middle of a pandemic. They just want sales. They are allowing up to 600 people in the store at a time. Employees have to dodge people like it's a minefield. It's just a complete breakdown at every level.BuzzFeed News also reports that Costco has refused to address these media enquiries, but in a past internal email, Craig Jelinek told restless employees that as a company, quote, We've undertaken countless and extraordinary changes in our warehouses...for the health, safety, and well being of our employees and members.No matter what its disgruntled members or employees say, Costco appears to be sticking to its guns over the face mask policy for now. According to Jelinek,We're choosing to err on the side of safety in our shopping environments. Costco has continued to operate during this crisis as an essential business in all of our communities, and our employees are on the front lines. As part of a community, we believe this simple act of safety and courtesy is one that Costco members and employees can undertake together.The company also reminded its members that the CDC recommendation on the use of face masks is clear: People should use cloth face coverings, quote, in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain ([for example] grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.Costco also continues to emphasize the importance of social distancing along with the use of face masks, to prevent people who might be asymptomatic from spreading the virus to people who are well.#Costco #BoycottCostco #SupermarketsRead the full article here: https://www.mashed.com/206563/the-real-reason-shoppers-are-boycotting-costco-right-now/"

After a whirlwind romance with her boyfriend, she’s on cloud nine after he made it official, proposing to her in front of all her family and friends. Cautious, but optimistic, Cynthia wonders if she can mend her roller-coaster relationship with friend turned foe Nene Leakes. Still elated from the wedding of her dreams, Eva Marcille is expecting baby number three, while juggling the ups and downs of her friendships, the challenges of pregnancy, and trying to find her dream home before the arrival of her baby. Always in high demand, Kandi Burruss’ life shows no signs of slowing down as she expands her empire while expanding her family with the help of a surrogate. Her husband optimistically seeks to open more businesses, but with so many balls in the air, Kandi worries they won’t have time to get everything done before the arrival of their newest family member. Always moving forward, Nene Leakes has reconnected with her husband, who is now cancer-free, but tensions rise when she is reunited with former friends to hash out past grievances. Porsha Williams is over the moon about her baby girl Pilar Jhena and couldn’t be more excited to be a mother. Dealing with the aftermath of salacious rumors surrounding her fiancé's infidelity, she is faced with the cold truth that her happily-ever-after may be on hold until she can figure out where her relationship stands. Back and bolder than ever...Kenya Moore has finally gotten what she’s always wanted with her husband and baby Brooklyn, but a fairy-tale ending isn’t always what it seems, and despite her best efforts, her roller coaster relationship may be coming to an end. Although motherhood has been kind to her and she enjoys embracing her softer side, she will never walk away from a challenge or shy away from speaking her mind.
